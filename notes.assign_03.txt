-playing catchup for a project I last worked on 2 weeks ago.  I implemented most
 of the code (I think), but I need to review that I have it (since I was just 
 wrapping up the endpoints last I looked).
-Ahh ok, I added the db schema change, not the new endpoints, and I haven't added
 the new endpoints yet
-check out "http://landscape.cncf.io" for a list of tools/platforms I can use
 for all this stuff.
-Oh!  Right.  I'm still using sqlite, until the whole thing is working.
